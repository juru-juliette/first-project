        <li>I am a bible techer: Preaching is the best choice i have made <br></li>
        <li>in my life ,we realize that most people have their own religious <br></li>
        <li>beliefs and that not everyone is interested in our message. Still,<br></li> 
        <li>we feel that Bible teachings are lifesaving. That is why we continue <br></li>
        <li>“without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ,”<br></li> 
        <li>as did the first-century Christians.</li>
