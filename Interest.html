        <li>spending time with my friend:I love hanging out with <br>
        because I always have a good time no matter what I'm going through</li>
        <li>I am a bible techer: Preaching is the best choice i have made <br>
        in my life ,we realize that most people have their own religious <br>
        beliefs and that not everyone is interested in our message. Still,<br> 
        we feel that Bible teachings are lifesaving. That is why we continue <br>
        “without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ,”<br>
        as did the first-century Christians.</li>
